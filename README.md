This is an edited version of my final for one of my classes. I have taken a lot of things out due to security reasons and for the sake of a bit of privacy.

Created with XAMPP MariaDB database for testing ease. The SQL files can be found within the project to create your own versions of my working database.

This is a site that I had to make for a Web-250 Course. This site was to have some simple features that most sites have. The site isn't fully functional but the main things work just fine.
